# TODOLIST assignment
put all the efforts to did this assignment but didnt done it sucessfully. I watched the class vedios and MS Learning moduals youtubes but still not get the idea how to finish work. re do it two to three times follow all the steps again but no luck. Didnt able to put more afforts because me and my daughter was not feeling well at that time. At last i ask one of my friend to help me or guide me and he did and i try to solve it in my own project but it was too confusing because i tried it multiple times so it has multiple folder already with the almost same name. so i made new repository and did it again. Althought i know about all the code what it is doing everything but i dont know why it is not running in my project. i will definetly ask professor about this and try to solve my errors after this semester.
